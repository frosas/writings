An experiment in writing articles as if they were part of a software project.

### Principles

- Any content is meant to be kept up to date, otherwise it should be part of the [history](https://github.com/frosas/writings/commits/master)
- This is an open source project, feel free to contribute with [issues](https://github.com/frosas/writings/issues) and [pull requests](pull requests) :)
