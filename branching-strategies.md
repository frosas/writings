## Branching strategies

A walkthrough to a project ideal branching strategy.

### No branches

That is, you don't use any source control system.

Pros: it's simple

Cons: it's too simple for any real piece of software. Probably you only want to do this when creating something with a lifespan of minutes (like a [kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)), for example).
